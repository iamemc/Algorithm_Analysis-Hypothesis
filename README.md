INTRODUCTION
---------------

> This program allows to easily calculate the slope of a curve for algorithm analysis
> by allowing us to calculate 	N and T(N) of given curve values and predict the 
> next values of a curve. The equation is as follow:
> 
> To find T(N): a*N^b
> 
> To find N knowing T: log(N(1)/TN(0))
